This repository holds my solutions for the 2021 Advent of Code.

While each day has its own module, some common utility functions live in the
`aoc2021` subdirectory.

The `makefile` is just there so that typing `make` automatically runs the
program of the day with its associated input (which consists of executing
`python -m XX XX/input` where `XX` is the day).
